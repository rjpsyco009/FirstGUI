First project, which is a simple GUI.

Written in Java on NetBeans

The program takes user input for sales representatives and writes the information to a file. This file can then be read on the GUI, or can be Evaluated. Evaluation checks each record to see if the Office Supplies, Books, and Paper sales are >=8,000. If so, the Representative is written to Stars.txt to hold them as "bonus reps" for making such high sales.

11.12.17 - Verification of input is there, though there may be a few bugs. Stars.txt is written to twice with each record. I was told this was an issue with how NetBeans auto-generates GUI code. Not sure what the solution would be there.
